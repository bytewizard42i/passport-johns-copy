# Tempo Passkeys Investigation

## Overview

[Tempo](https://tempo.xyz) is a blockchain that implements native passkey-based authentication at the protocol level. Their onboarding UX eliminates browser extensions, mobile apps, and seed phrases entirely — users sign up with a passkey (Face ID, Touch ID, YubiKey, etc.) and get a self-custodial wallet instantly.

This investigation focuses on what Midnight would need to support in order to reuse Tempo's libraries and achieve a similar passkey-powered UX.

## Midnight Compatibility Requirements

To reuse Tempo's ecosystem of libraries, Midnight would need two major additions:

### 1. ETH-style Address Format

Tempo uses standard EVM-compatible **0x addresses** (20 bytes). Addresses are derived from P-256 public keys:

```
address = last_20_bytes(keccak256(abi.encode(pubkey.x, pubkey.y)))
```

Where `x` and `y` are the 32-byte coordinates of the P-256 public key.

Midnight would need to either:

- Support this address format natively (alongside any existing format), or
- Provide a mapping/translation layer

### 2. P-256 (secp256r1) Curve Support

WebAuthn passkeys produce **P-256 (secp256r1)** signatures — this is hardcoded into the WebAuthn spec because P-256 is natively supported by all hardware secure enclaves (Apple Secure Enclave, Android Keystore, YubiKeys). This is a different curve than the secp256k1 used by Bitcoin/Ethereum traditionally.

Tempo supports three signature types at the protocol level:

| Key Type        | ID  | Curve     | Use Case                                       |
| --------------- | --- | --------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| secp256k1 ECDSA | 0   | secp256k1 | Traditional EVM wallets                        |
| P-256 ECDSA     | 1   | secp256r1 | Secure enclave / WebCrypto keys                |
| WebAuthn        | 2   | secp256r1 | Passkeys (with origin binding + user presence) |

Midnight would need P-256 signature verification in its consensus/validation layer.

## P-256 vs secp256k1

| Aspect              | P-256 (secp256r1)              | secp256k1                        |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------ | -------------------------------- |
| Origin              | NIST standard                  | Koblitz curve (Bitcoin/Ethereum) |
| Hardware support    | Native on all modern devices   | Not natively supported           |
| Standards           | WebCrypto, TLS, FIDO2, PKI     | Bitcoin, Ethereum                |
| Security level      | ~128 bits                      | ~128 bits                        |
| Performance         | Slower (more field operations) | Faster (special structure)       |
| WebAuthn compatible | Yes                            | No                               |

The fundamental incompatibility: hardware-backed passkeys produce P-256 signatures, but traditional blockchains verify secp256k1. This is the core gap Tempo solves by supporting both natively.

## Tempo Account Model

### Keychain Architecture

A Tempo Account is a **keychain** of authorized keys, managed by the Account Keychain precompile at `0xAAAAAAAA00000000000000000000000000000000`:

- **Root Key** (`keyId = address(0)`): The passkey (P-256/WebAuthn) that created the account. This is the user's biometric-backed key (Face ID, Touch ID, YubiKey). Full authority — can authorize new keys, revoke keys, update spending limits.
- **Access Keys** (aka session keys): Secondary keys authorized by the Root Key. Support multiple signature types (secp256k1, P-256, WebAuthn). Each can have:
  - Expiry timestamps
  - Per-token spending limits
  - Scoped permissions

This is analogous to SSH `authorized_keys` or OAuth refresh tokens across devices.

### Cross-App / Cross-Device Usage

Tempo uses **cross-origin iframe embedding** for SSO-like wallet experience:

- Third-party apps embed a thin iframe from `wallet.tempo.xyz`
- The iframe has `allow="publickey-credentials-create; publickey-credentials-get"` permission policy
- Passkey ceremony runs inside the iframe, bound to the `tempo.xyz` RP ID
- Communication via `postMessage`

Security hardening:

- **Access Keys**: The embedded experience authorizes a scoped Access Key for the third-party app (not the root signer)
- **IntersectionObserverV2**: Detects clickjacking attempts — if iframe is obscured, pops out to standalone window

### Tempo Transactions (EIP-2718 type 0x76)

Custom transaction format with:

- Batched calls (atomic multi-call execution)
- **2D nonces** (nonce_key + nonce) — enables parallel transaction streams from a single account
- `valid_before` / `valid_after` timestamps
- Fee token preference (pay fees in any stablecoin, no native token required)
- Fee payer signature (sponsored transactions, magic byte 0x78)
- Key authorization field for delegated permissions

### Access Key Storage

Access keys are **software-backed** private keys (P-256 or secp256k1) — unlike the passkey root key which is hardware-backed and non-extractable. They need to be stored somewhere:

**Wallet (wallet.tempo.xyz):**

- `KeyManager.localStorage()` — stores access key private keys in browser localStorage. Simple but **not recommended for production**: keys are lost if the user clears browser data or switches devices, with no recovery mechanism.
- `KeyManager.http()` — remote key management. Removes dependency on local browser storage, better for cross-device scenarios. This is the recommended production approach.

**CLI Wallet (`tempoxyz/wallet` — Rust):**

The wallet is a separate Rust binary installed as an extension to the Tempo node via `tempo add wallet`. It lives in its own repo ([tempoxyz/wallet](https://github.com/tempoxyz/wallet)).

Keys are stored in a **`keys.toml`** file at `$TEMPO_HOME/wallet/keys.toml` (defaults to `~/.tempo/wallet/keys.toml`). The file is written with `0o600` permissions (owner-only read/write) via atomic rename. Each key entry in `keys.toml` contains:

```toml
[[keys]]
wallet_type = "passkey"        # or "local" (self-custodial EOA)
wallet_address = "0x..."       # the on-chain account address
chain_id = 4217
key_type = "p256"              # or "secp256k1" or "webauthn"
key_address = "0x..."          # public address derived from the access key
key = "0x..."                  # the access key private key (inline, plaintext)
key_authorization = "0x..."    # RLP-encoded SignedKeyAuthorization hex
expiry = 1700000000            # unix timestamp

[[keys.limits]]
currency = "0x..."             # token contract address
limit = "1000"                 # spending limit
```

Key details from the source code (`tempoxyz/wallet/crates/tempo-common/src/keys/`):

- **`WalletType`**: `Local` (self-custodial EOA in OS keychain) or `Passkey` (browser auth)
- **`KeyType`**: `Secp256k1`, `P256`, or `WebAuthn`
- Private keys are wrapped in `Zeroizing<String>` (scrubbed from memory on drop) but stored **in plaintext** on disk
- The keystore supports ephemeral keys via `--private-key` flag (never written to disk)
- Key selection priority: passkey entries > first entry with a key > first entry
- Authentication flow: user runs `tempo wallet login` → authenticates with passkey → passkey authorizes a CLI-specific access key → access key + authorization stored in `keys.toml` → subsequent operations sign with the access key

**Key distinction:** The passkey root key is non-extractable and hardware-backed (Secure Enclave, Android Keystore). Access keys are regular extractable private keys stored in software. This is a deliberate tradeoff — access keys are scoped and expendable (expiry, spending limits), so the risk of exposure is bounded.

### Passkey Recovery

If you lose access to your passkey (root key):

- Passkeys sync via OS keychain (iCloud Keychain, Google Password Manager) or password managers (1Password) — so if you're logged into iCloud on another device, your passkey is already there
- Access keys on other devices can still sign transactions (within their authorized scope)
- Can add Ledger, YubiKey, or other keystores as additional access keys for backup/2FA
- If you truly lose all access to both the passkey and all access keys, funds are unrecoverable (same as losing a seed phrase)

## What Midnight Needs

For Midnight to adopt passkey-based accounts similar to Tempo:

### Protocol-Level

- [ ] **P-256 signature verification** in Nightstream / consensus rules — this is what passkeys (the root key) produce
- [ ] **Address derivation** that accepts P-256 public keys (ETH-style or a Midnight equivalent) — the account address is derived from the passkey's P-256 public key
- [ ] **Multiple signature algorithm support** in transaction validation (at minimum P-256 for the passkey root key; optionally also secp256k1 and WebAuthn for access keys)
- [ ] **Account abstraction** — keychain model where the passkey is the root key, and access keys (session keys) can be authorized for scoped, time-limited use by dApps and other devices

### Client-Side

- [ ] **WebAuthn integration** — use `webauthx` or similar for passkey registration (creating the root key) and authentication (signing with it)
- [ ] **Wallet SDK** — either adapt Porto SDK or build equivalent that targets Midnight instead of Ethereum RPCs. This is what manages the passkey root key and issues access keys (session keys) to dApps.
- [ ] **Wagmi/Viem adapter** — if reusing the wevm stack, need a Midnight chain definition + RPC transport

### Considerations

- **Chain-agnostic packages** (webauthx, ox's WebAuthnP256) can likely be reused as-is
- **Tempo-specific packages** (Porto SDK, Porto Account Contracts, Relay) would need adaptation or reimplementation for Midnight's transaction format and RPC layer
- The Rust `p256` crate from RustCrypto could be used directly in Midnight's Rust-based node implementation
- **Gas/cost model**: P-256 verification is ~100x more expensive than secp256k1 in EVM without a precompile; Midnight would want native support rather than doing this in a circuit

## PRF Extension (Future Opportunity)

The WebAuthn **PRF (Pseudo-Random Function) extension** allows each passkey to derive unique encryption keys per site/application. The authenticator evaluates a PRF using a device-stored secret key + relying party input, producing a deterministic 32-byte value.

Use cases for Midnight:

- **Per-dApp session key derivation** — hardware-backed, no seed phrase
- **End-to-end encrypted private state** — derive encryption keys for dApp-specific data
- **Account recovery** — deterministic key derivation from passkey

Platform support (as of early 2026): Android (Google Password Manager), macOS (Safari 18+, Chrome 132+), iOS 18.4+.

Moxie Marlinspike (Signal founder) is using PRF in his new project Confer for E2E encrypted chat, which validates the approach.

## Known Limitations of Passkeys

1. **WKWebView on mobile** — passkeys don't work in iOS WKWebView (used by apps like X.com for in-app browsing). Workaround: guide user to open in Safari or use `ASWebAuthenticationSession`.
2. **Total device + cloud loss** — if you lose all devices AND aren't logged into iCloud/1Password AND didn't add access keys, funds are unrecoverable. Same as losing a seed phrase with no backup.
3. **Browser support gaps** — Android phones pre-2018, devices without Google Play Services, legacy desktop OS (Windows 7/8). Overall coverage: 95% phones, 97% browsers.
